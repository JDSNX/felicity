# Felicity: Raspberry Pi-Based Speech Recognition Command and Fall Detection System for Elderly Patient

The Felicity: Raspberry Pi-Based Speech Recognition Command
and Fall Detection System for Elderly Patient will provide the 
elderly patient to control easily the `lights`, `windows`, `doors` and 
a fall detection that `detect fall accident` for elderly patient. 
This system grants the attendants/nurses to monitor the elderly 
patient efficiently.

The system is composed of different modules, integrated to 
fulfill the objectives of the system. Speech recognition command 
for the elderly patient to control the `lights`, `windows`, and `doors`. 
Fall detection system to `detect fall accident` for the elderly 
patient and a monitoring application system for the 
attendants/nurses to display all the information of the elderly 
patients and records the time and date of the executed command.

The effectiveness of the speech recognition command depends 
on the distance from the microphone concerning the sound level of 
the voice. The distance from 4 feet below produces the best 
accuracy of around 100%. Fall detection result determines by the 
distance of the falling device from the router. In addition, the 
monitoring application system will prompt family/friends via SMS 
to the emergency contact of the elderly patient and `alert the 
attendants/nurses` via monitoring application when fall accidents 
happen inside the room.
